### Project Overview
This project aim to investigate the top 10 Programming Language Trend over the past five year over a huge dataset. We are required to create a new data table that contains desired features from the original dataset. The expected output from the DataFrame includes: language, quarter, post_count, percentage_of_total, and growth_rate.

### Tools
- pyspark & Spark SQL: For data filtering
- window function: For compute growth trends over time
- Matplotlib: For creating trend visualizations

### About The Project
- A cleaned and filtered dataset by language and quarter (from 2019 ~ 2024)
- A visualization showing top 10 programming language popularity trends over time
- A table highlighting the top 5 fastest-growing and top 5 fastest-declining languages


### Findings
The Expected output includes language, quarter, post_count, percentage_of_total, and growth_rate.
The visualization shows that R language has the most explicit declines over the past 5 years.
